# Predicting-flight-delays
In this project, I developed a model to predict flight delays using a dataset. For this, I had to explore the data using pandas and matplotlib, analyze data distribution, perform feature engineering, utilize the RandomForestRegressor model to train it, conduct cross-validation, and optimize hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
